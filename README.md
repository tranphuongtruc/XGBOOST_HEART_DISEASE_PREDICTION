# XGBOOST HEART DISEASE PREDICTION
## Description
- As you may see, it is very difficult to accurately identify and predict early symptoms of heart disease due to many factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal heart rhythms, and other factors. Today, the amount of data in the healthcare industry is vast (big data). Therefore, data mining and extracting information from this large dataset is necessary to assist in early diagnosis and prevention of potential cardiovascular complications. As a result, scientists have begun researching modern methods such as Data Mining and Machine Learning to predict heart disease early based on patients' medical histories.
- In this project, we will apply basic machine learning methods to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease using the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets).



## Installation

#### Running the Notebook on your computer

1. *Clone the repository:*
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tranphuongtruc/XGBOOST_HEART_DISEASE_PREDICTION.git
    cd XGBOOST_HEART_DISEASE_PREDICTION
    ```

2. *(Optional)Create a virtual environment:*
   
    On Windows:
 
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
